            <h3>EACYPAA Service Workshop</h3>
            <p>The DC bid for EACYPAA invites you to come out and learn more about service. Listen to speakers share on topics such as helping the newcomer, getting involved in service at your homegroup, and getting involved in area level service! We will also have tables with open service opportunities. There cannot be this much text under each event or it will look really bad.</p>
